/* Quicksort, like mergesort, (and technically Gold's poresort as well I 
think) is another divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. But the way that 
quicksort works is by having two variables, i and j, swap around their 
elements based on a pivot variable, where the value of pivot is the value 
of the first element in the list. (Though other implementations may use a 
randomly chosen element for pivot.) i will start at the left and move 
rightwards, swapping over elements that are larger than pivot. j will 
start at the right and move leftwards, swapping over elements that are 
smaller than pivot. At some point, i and j will pass each other. That is 
pivot's cue to swap places with j. This causes the pivot to be put into 
its final place in the list; all elements to the left of pivot will be 
less than pivot and all elements to the right of pivot will be greater 
than or equal to pivot. So, ultimately, we were just trying to find 
pivot's final place in the list. Now, the location of pivot creates two 
sublists: one to the left of pivot, and one to the right of pivot. Then, 
quicksort is performed on these sublists, which will probably generate 
more sublists in turn. This process will continue until the generated 
sublists become so small (i.e. the sublist contains less than 2 elements) 
that quicksort is not needed for them, so, eventually, there will be no 
more sublists to sort, allowing this algorithm to finish execution. I 
will say though, it would probably be easier to just watch a video of 
quicksort in action, as opposed to simply reading words: 
https://youtu.be/7h1s2SojIRw?t=262. (Although his implementation of 
quicksort is recursive, unlike mine, which is iterative, (you won't see 
quicksort() make any calls to quicksort() here) the general idea is still 
the same.) */
