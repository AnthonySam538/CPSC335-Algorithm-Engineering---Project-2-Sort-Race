predicted by looking at the size of the list. This is used to set the

/* Quicksort, like mergesort, (and technically Gold's poresort as well I 
think) is another divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. But the way that 
quicksort works is by having two variables, i and j swap around their 
elements based on a pivot variable, where the value of pivot is the value 
of the first element in the list. (Though other implementations may use a 
randomly chosen element for pivot.) i will move rightwards, swapping over 
elements that are larger than pivot. j will move leftwards, swapping over 
elements that are smaller than pivot. At some point, i and j will pass 
each other. This is pivot's cue to swap places with j. This causes the 
pivot to be put into its final place in the list; all elements to the left 
of pivot will be less than pivot and all elements to the right of pivot 
will be greater than or equal to pivot. So, ultimately, we were just 
trying to find pivot's place in the list. Now, the location of pivot 
creates two sublists: one to the left of pivot's final location, and one 
to the right of pivot's final location. Then, quicksort is performed on 
these sublists, which will probably generate more sublists in turn. This 
process will continue until the generated sublists become so small (i.e. 
the sublist contains less than 2 elements) that quicksort is not needed 
for them, so eventually, there will be no more sublists to sort, allowing 
this algorithm to finish execution. I will say though, it would probably 
be easier to just watch a video of quicksort in action, as opposed to 
simply reading words: https://youtu.be/7h1s2SojIRw?t=262. Although his 
implementation of quicksort is recursive, unlike mine, which is iterative, 
(you won't see quicksort() make any calls to quicksort() here) the general 
idea is still the same. */
